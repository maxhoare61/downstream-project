				In 2025 the four-pillar oligopoly in Australia’s banking sector
				is more entrenched than ever. Today, the big four banks make up
				~25% of the market value of Australia’s 50 largest companies.
				Their enormity allows them to crowd out smaller companies and
				price services above their fair value. Despite these downsides
				and more, attempts to remedy the situation have so far failed. To
				abate the impact of insufficient competition on everyday
				Australians, which is already taking a toll, it is pertinent for
				policymakers to consider methods that are likely to be
				implemented in the short term. Fortunately, Australian’s
				penchant for digital finance tools may present an alternative,
				market-driven solution to improve competition in retail banking,
				through a set of policies known as <i>Open Finance</i>.
			</p>
			<h2>What is Open Finance?</h2>
			<p>
				Open Finance is a policy framework which enables consumers to
				easily share their data with financial services firms through
				secure portals. This is a departure from the current paradigm
				where businesses who hold your personal data have control over
				it. Open Finance can create a more competitive banking industry,
				by lowering the legal and technological barriers that have held
				back customers from accessing their information, prevented them
				from easily sharing it with third parties, and thus deterred
				them from switching to different financial institutions.
			</p>

			<p>
				Through a secure and centralised system of financial data,
				consumers may choose to share information with third party
				“FinTech” firms who could use it to provide novel, personalised
				financial services. For instance, businesses could offer
				customers insights into their financial standing, or help them
				to find a loan suited to their specific financial needs.
				Additionally, by making a variety of data points on an
				individual readily available, Open Finance makes it easier for
				loan providers to verify groups with atypical credit profiles
				who may struggle to pass standard credit checks. For instance,
				students or gig economy workers.
			</p>
			<figure class="bar-chart">
				<figcaption class="caption lead">
					Open Finance helps consumers reclaim ownership of their data
					and use it to their benefit.
				</figcaption>
				<figcaption class="caption subcaption">
					Traditionally, financial service providers (your bank) had
					total control over your data. Open finance gives you the
					ability to share this data with other organisations in a
					secure fashion. This creates opportunities to access new
					financial services and providers easily, encouraging banks
					to provide a more competitive deal for their customers.
				</figcaption>
				<img

				/>
			</figure>
			<p>
				While public awareness of Open Finance remains modest, policy
				development has continued to accelerate around the world since
				2015. As of November 2024, 95 countries have taken concrete
				steps toward implementing Open Finance frameworks, ranging from
				early-stage consultations and pilot programs to fully
				operational regimes. Over the coming years, many of these
				initiatives will transition into live systems.
			</p>
			<h2>Policy Strategy</h2>
			<p>
				Governments’ Open Finance policy approaches can differ based on
				the specific objectives they have for the banking sector in
				their country. Key differences between countries policy include
				the scope of data types being shared, which organisations
				participate, if participation is mandatory, and the degree of
				government involvement in implementation. There are three main
				policy configurations that have been adopted so far.
			</p>
			<h5>
				Informal economies with high digital finance tool penetration
			</h5>
			<p>
				Countries such as Brazil, Nigeria, and India are using Open
				Finance to build on existing digital infrastructure and expand
				access to the formal financial system for previously unbanked
				populations. While digital payments and mobile finance are
				already widespread, traditional credit scoring often excludes
				self-employed individuals and those without formal income
				records. By enabling the use of alternative data, Open Finance
				makes it easier for these individuals to be verified and access
				credit. Greater participation in the formal financial sector not
				only supports economic activity by allowing more people to
				borrow and invest, but also improves data quality and broadens
				the tax base.
			</p>
			<h5>
				Developed economies with concentrated domestic finance
				industries
			</h5>
			<p>
				Consumer data rights and antitrust concerns characterise the
				policy goals for Open Finance in developed economies with high
				formal participation. Developed countries with concentrated
				domestic financial industries, such as Australia, the UK, and
				the EU, have been more hands on with their Open Finance
				policies, legislating mandatory participation for some
				organisations, and pursuing a broader base of data types to be
				shared. While Australia and the EU are yet to reap the fully
				suite of benefits from Open Finance, these policies are already
				reducing high-risk practices such as screen scraping, where
				users provide their username and password to a third party to
				access their data. The UK continues to be a leader in Open
				Finance, with one of the most robust policy frameworks globally,
				and over 13.3 million active users in 2025.
			</p>
			<h5>
				Developed economies with competitive domestic finance industries
			</h5>
			<p>
				Other developed countries have fiercely competitive domestic
				finance industries and favour a less interventionalist policy
				approach. These include Hong Kong, Singapore, and the USA. So
				far, these governments have pursued partially or wholly
				market-based solutions where they work alongside private
				financial institutions to support their voluntary participation
				in data sharing. This approach comes with its own risks, since
				it delegates responsibility for data sharing infrastructure to
				third party private “data aggregator” firms. Without regulation,
				these two can form a concentrated “two-sided” market,
				potentially reinforcing the very concentration of data ownership
				Open Finance was intended to dismantle. In the USA, data
				aggregators such as “plaid” have already claimed a
				disproportionate amount of market share in the Open Finance
				ecosystem, which will need to be addressed in subsequent policy
				reform to ensure data sharing can function in an effective
				manner.
			</p>
			<figure class="bar-chart">
				<figcaption class="caption lead">
					Developed economies use Open Finance as a tool for
					stimulating competition and improving data security in the
					finance industry.

				<figcaption class="caption subcaption">

					population for each country shown.

					alt="Policy progress and uptake of Open Finance in developed economies"
					class="bar-chart-img"
				/>
			</figure>
			<h5>Risks</h5>
			<p>
				In the last five years, data breaches have become larger, more
				frequent, and more costly. Open Finance systems risk becoming a
				target of such attacks without sufficient security standards
				governing both data transmission and infrastructure. As Open
				Finance expands the scope of financial data collection and
				transmission, the risks associated with its implementation grow
				in parallel. As a variety personal data sources become
				integrated into FinTech services, there is the risk that some
				users are excluded due to algorithmic prejudice or biases, such
				as those previously observed in the insurance industry. User
				consent is a core part of Open Finance, but could be vulnerable
				to cyber criminals if not implemented with the proper
				protections. It is essential that user consent is unambiguously
				obtained, securely verified, and retractable to ensure
				individuals have total autonomy over how their data is used. To
				dissuade firms from negligent handling of personal data, a clear
				system for accountability is needed the case of data misuse or
				abuse. It is critical that policy ensures there is no ambiguity
				over whether responsibility for a breach lies with the bank, the
				API aggregator, or the fintech. Without strong safeguards
				against these risks, it is likely both consumers and
				institutions will be hesitant to participate, slowing the flow
				of intended benefits, such as greater competition and
				innovation.
			</p>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				Open Finance is a promising policy tool with a range of enticing
				benefits for consumers and financial institutions alike. By
				enabling secure data sharing, it can lower barriers to entry for
				new entrants, foster competition, and improve the quality of
				financial services.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, there is no “one size fits all” solution to Open
				Finance policy. The best policy approach for a country depends
				on the structure and concentration of the existing financial
				landscape, industry objectives and consumer interest. So far,
				countries with strong consumer uptake of Open Finance tools have
				been characterised by fast and early policy implementation,
				strong pre-existing digital finance infrastructure, and the
				policy flexibility to enable and meet the needs of their
				population.
