					In 2004, BP‚Äôs marketing underwent a remarkable
					transformation. The oil behemoth ditched it‚Äôs dated red
					shield logo in favour of a new green-and-yellow flower and
					adopted tagline ‚ÄúBeyond Petroleum‚Äù. As part of this campaign
					the company also introduced a ‚Äúcarbon footprint calculator‚Äù
					on its website. The concept was simple: people could go
					online, enter details about their daily activities (driving,
					electricity use, flights, etc.), and calculate their
					personal annual carbon emissions. BP launched print
					advertisements in major newspapers which prompted readers to <span
						class="italic"
						>‚ÄúFind out the size of your household‚Äôs carbon
						footprint, learn how you can reduce it, and see how
						we‚Äôre reducing ours at bp.com‚Äù.</span

				<p>
					Framing climate change in these personal terms was a
					deliberate strategy. As a company then marketing itself as
					‚ÄúBeyond Petroleum,‚Äù BP sought to position itself as part of
					the climate solution while subtly shifting the locus of
					responsibility to individual consumers. Environmental
					historians and climate scholars note that although academics
					had introduced broader ‚Äúecological footprint‚Äù metrics in the
					1990s, the carbon footprint as a household concept entered
					the popular lexicon largely due to this industry-driven PR
					effort. Climate scientist Michael E. Mann observes that this
					move was part of a broader shift in tactics by fossil fuel
					interests. The shift from outright climate science denial to
					a technique called ‚Äúdeflection‚Äù, the idea that the public
					should focus on their own actions rather than corporate
					behaviour.

			<h2>BPs Millenial Makeover</h2>
			<div class="paragraph-2">
				<p>
					By the early 2000s, scientific consensus on climate change
					was solidifying, and public awareness of the issue was
					growing. BP, one of the world‚Äôs largest oil companies,
					increasingly faced what seemed to be an existential threat.
					In response, it undertook a major rebranding to portray
					itself as environmentally conscious. The carbon footprint
					campaign was a centrepiece of this rebranding. By
					encouraging individuals to measure their own emissions, BP‚Äôs
					messaging implied that climate change is the result of
					personal choices: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, I'm doing my part - <span
						class="italic"
					>
						what about you?‚Äù</span
					>.
				</p>
				<p>
					This framing not only places the burden of responsibility on
					consumers but alleviates corporate polluters. Instead of
					being seen as one of the worst perpetrators of environmental
					havoc, they were trying to make a difference‚Ä¶ by asking
					everyday people to do the work for them. This positioned the
					company as ‚Äòdoing their part‚Äô by providing tools and
					encouragement, despite their core business still being
					overwhelmingly in high emissions activities.
				</p>
				<p>
					In reality, BP never truly moved ‚Äúbeyond petroleum‚Äù ‚Äì in
					2005, for example, BP produced about 4.0 million barrels of
					oil per day. Fifteen years after the ‚ÄòBeyond Petroleum‚Äô
					campaign, it was still about 3.8 million barrels. As of
					2018, BP devoted only 2.3% of its budget to renewable
					energy, with the rest sustaining its fossil fuel operations.
					Such figures lay bare the greenwashing at play: the personal
					carbon footprint initiative was less about BP reducing its
					own emissions and more about influencing public narratives
					around who is responsible for climate change.

			<h2>What Does the Data Say? Personal vs Corporate Emissions</h2>
			<div class="paragraph-2">
				<p>
					If everyone is responsible for their carbon footprint, how
					big are those footprints really? How do they compare to the
					carbon pollution emitted by large fossil fuel companies? The
					data overwhelmingly show that corporate and industrial
					emissions dwarf even large numbers of households. According
					to a report by Carbon Majors, just 25 corporate and state
					entities account for over 50% of industrial carbon emissions
					worldwide in the period since 1988. These companies include
					the likes of BP, Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron, alongside state
					oil enterprises. BP itself is a notable contributor:
					analyses show that BP‚Äôs operations and products were the
					source of about 1.5% of total global industrial emissions
					from 1998‚Äì2015 ‚Äì a remarkable fraction for a single company,
					given that there are thousands of companies in the world‚Äôs
					energy sector. For perspective, this percentage is greater
					than the percentage of global annual emissions produced in
					Oceania.
				</p>
				<p>
					The emissions produced by the average individual pale in
					comparison to those created by large corporations and state
					entities. The average individual‚Äôs emissions, even in
					high-income countries, are a fraction of a fraction of
					corporate carbon footprints. In Australia ‚Äì which has one of
					the highest per-capita carbon footprints ‚Äì the average
					person‚Äôs activities produce about 15.4 tons of CO‚ÇÇ per year.
					Multiplying that by almost 27 million Australians yields
					about 415.8 million tons ‚Äì which is significant. However,
					that is a meagre 5.6% of the 7.4 billion tonnes of Co2
					produced by just 5 entities (Saudi Aramco, Coal India, CHN
					Energy, National Iranian Oil Co., and Jinneng Group) in
					2023. In other words, if everyone in Australia used no
					electricity, gas or petrol, it would take 17 years to
					recuperate the emissions produced by those 5 companies in a
					single year. This underscores that climate change is not
					simply the result of billions of people negligently leaving
					lights on; rather, it‚Äôs driven by industrial activity and
					energy production choices. As experts have pointed out, the
					real leavers with the power to make change -systemic factors
					like how electricity is generated, how goods are produced,
					and what policies govern energy use determine the bulk of
					emissions ‚Äì are influenced by corporate and governmental
					control far more than any average person.

			<h2>Bonus: Lessons from Covid-19</h2>
			<div class="paragraph-2">
				<p>
					It is telling that even when individual behaviour changed
					dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic the drop in global
					CO‚ÇÇ emissions was on the order of 6‚Äì8% for 2020. This
					temporary reduction ‚Äì achieved by an unprecedented
					curtailment of personal travel and consumption ‚Äì was still
					modest relative to the cuts needed to stabilize the climate.
					The chart below shows the quarterly national emissions data
					for Australia, with the shaded area approximately covering
					the time affected by the pandemic. While there is a
					definitive slump in emissions evident during the pandemic,
					it is hardly on the order implied by the mantra that our
					‚Äúindividual efforts make all the difference‚Äù. Moreover, the
					decrease in emissions during the pandemic represented part
					of a broader downward trend due to the decarbonisation of
					the grid, evident in the gradual shrinking of the blue
					‚Äòelectricity‚Äô layer over time. All in all, the emissions
					impact of this society wide change in behaviour was nominal.

				<p>
					This illustrates that the underlying causes of emissions
					cannot be changed by the personal decisions we make on a
					day-to-day basis. Even when millions of individuals can no
					longer partake in many of emitting activities that companies
					like BP encourage us to abstain from, there will always be a
					lower threshold beyond which you simply cannot reduce your
					emissions. This is because many emissions are the product of
					systems outside of our control. For instance, say you stop
					driving to work or taking flights. Now you will be using a
					larger amount of power at home to support basic necessities
					such as cooking and lighting, and the emissions intensity of
					this power is determined by the generation mix in the grid.
					To make this clear, between 2000 and 2023, the amount of CO‚ÇÇ
					produced per unit of energy generated in Australia has
					decreased by 47%. This enormous improvement, which affects
					the carbon footprint of all Australians, had nothing to do
					with individual decision-making. Rather, it was brought
					about through placing pressure on those in power, targeted
					policy, changing cultural attitudes and coordinated efforts
					to add renewable generation to the grid. While individual
					actions like recycling, or bicycling to work are worth
					encouraging, data-driven analyses consistently find that the
					largest climate impacts come from systemic changes:
					transitioning power grids to renewable energy, halting
					fossil fuel extraction, improving industrial efficiency, and
					enforcing emissions limits on big polluters.

			<h2>Influence on Public Perception and Discourse</h2>
			<div class="paragraph-2">
				<p>
					BP‚Äôs carbon footprint campaign and similar industry efforts
					have had a discernible impact on public perceptions of
					climate responsibility. The very fact that ‚Äúcarbon
					footprint‚Äù entered everyday vocabulary in the 2000s is
					testament to the campaign‚Äôs reach. Before BP‚Äôs push, the
					term was virtually non-existent in public discourse;
					afterwards, it became a centrepiece of climate
					conversations, educational programs, and even government
					advisories. Google search trends for ‚Äúcarbon footprint‚Äù
					spike after 2004, reflecting how quickly the concept caught
					on. Many people began meticulously tracking their personal
					carbon impacts ‚Äì from switching light bulbs to calculating
					flight emissions ‚Äì convinced that individual action was the
					paramount solution to climate change. Climate educators have
					noted how this focus can crowd out discussion of systemic
					action. Naomi Oreskes, the Harvard science historian, offers
					a telling anecdote: when giving public talks on climate
					change, she is almost invariably asked ‚ÄúWhat can I do,
					personally, to fix this problem?‚Äù far more often than she is
					asked about holding companies or governments accountable.
					This reflects a success of the fossil-fuel PR narrative: the
					public internalized the idea that personal lifestyle changes
					are the key to addressing climate change, while discussion
					of corporate responsibility or political action was
					comparatively muted. Indeed, Oreskes attributes that common
					sentiment in part to the marketing campaigns by BP, Exxon
					and others that relentlessly promoted personal carbon
					footprints.

						Trends)
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					However, there are signs that society‚Äôs view of an
					individual-based approach to fighting climate change is
					increasingly dim. Social scientists and climate
					communicators have increasingly critiqued the over-emphasis
					on individual action as a form of ‚Äúdiscursive manipulation‚Äù
					that can delay collective solutions. On social media, posts
					such as the one featured at the start of the article reflect
					the cultural shift. When a global company‚Äôs tweet
					encouraging climate action gets ratio‚Äôd by a no name account
					by a factor of 136, it is a sign that people no longer see
					empty climate platitudes from corporations through the same
					naive rose-tinted lens that they once did.
				</p>
				<p>
					Environmental organizations now often stress balancing
					personal steps with systemic change ‚Äì essentially
					re-educating the public that one cannot simply shop or
					recycle their way out of the climate crisis if policy and
					corporate practices remain unchanged. Importantly, public
					opinion is evolving: surveys indicate that people are
					increasingly aware of corporate culpability for climate
					change. A national survey in the United States (Yale, 2019)
					found that 57% of Americans believe fossil fuel companies
					have either ‚Äúa great deal‚Äù or ‚Äúa moderate amount‚Äù of
					responsibility for the damages caused by global warming. A
					similar majority supported requiring those companies to pay
					for a portion of climate damage costs. This suggests a shift
					in perception ‚Äì despite years of ‚Äúcarbon footprint‚Äù
					messaging, more than half the public now explicitly holds
					the industry accountable in substantial measure. In essence,
					while BP‚Äôs campaign succeeded in injecting personal carbon
					footprints into the climate zeitgeist, it has not completely
					forestalled a growing public recognition that the climate
					crisis is, at its core, a systemic problem requiring
					systemic solutions.

					Climate scientists like Michael Mann argue that while
					individual actions are helpful, we must not allow the
					narrative of personal responsibility to become a distraction
					or moral smoke-screen that delays larger interventions.
					Mann‚Äôs work The New Climate War calls out tactics like BP‚Äôs
					for what they are ‚Äì ‚Äúsoft denial‚Äù or deflection ‚Äì and
					emphasizes collective action: voting for climate-conscious
					leadership, enacting carbon pricing or emissions caps on
					industry, and supporting systemic changes in energy,
					transportation, and agriculture. In the same vein,
					environmental sociologists point out that individuals
					operate within infrastructures and choices shaped by
					companies and governments. For instance, if a person in a
					suburban area has a high carbon footprint from driving, it
					may be because public transit is inadequate ‚Äì a decision
					made by policy and investment, not personal moral failure.
					Professor Julia Steinberger, an ecological economist, notes
					that assigning emissions to end consumers doesn‚Äôt mean those
					consumers actually had the power to avoid them: ‚ÄúWho is
					actually taking the damaging decision?‚Äù she asks ‚Äì and in
					the case of fossil fuels, the decisions (to extract oil, to
					build fossil-powered infrastructure, to resist regulation)
					are taken by companies like BP, not average citizens.
					Reframing climate action in light of this insight means
					placing far greater emphasis on holding corporate actors
					accountable and changing systemic frameworks. This could
					involve measures like carbon taxes on producers, legal
					liabilities for climate damages (a path being pursued
					through various lawsuits), mandates for clean energy
					adoption, and transparency tools that publicly track
					companies‚Äô emissions and climate plans.

						We should aim for a more balanced climate discourse that

						To conclude, while each of us should take steps to live
