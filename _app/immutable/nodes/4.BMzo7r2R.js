				warming for the first time. Support from key public figures was
				slowly but surely pushing climate change into the Overton
				window. In 1996 Michael Jackson’s performance of “Earth Song” at
				the BRIT awards grabbed public attention due to its dramatic
				imagery of wind machines blowing his hair and clothes while he
				plead with the audience “What about crying whales? (What about
				us?) We're ravaging the seas (What about us?)”. Al Gore, a
				pro-environmental figurehead, achieved the popular vote in 2000,
				signalling significant support for his ideas. Secondly, extreme
				weather events were being associated with the greenhouse effect
				for the first time, which elevated its profile in public
				discussion during natural disasters. Incidents such as extreme
				droughts in the US in 1988, a global record-breaking El Nino in
				1998, and the ensuing devastation, were feared to be influenced
				by “man-made” factors. These changes pushed climate change out
				of the dark and into the public eye for the first time.</p> <figure class="bar-chart svelte-q6hi1k"><figcaption class="caption lead svelte-q6hi1k">Most people heard about climate change for the first time in

					Collated by Nisbet and Myers (2007)</figcaption> <img alt="Bar chart of climate awareness increasing in the 2000s" class="bar-chart-img svelte-q6hi1k"></figure> <p class="svelte-q6hi1k">Around this time, petrol titan BP suddenly, radically, reworked
				their vibe. Their visual brand transformed into a cacophony of
				warm green and yellow hues and soft, lowercase font. They
				adopted a new logo resembling a shining sun, drastically out of
				step with the staunch, blocky logos of its oil peers and parted
				with their long-time name British Petroleum, in favour of Beyond
				Petroleum. Taken on face value, their theatrical new branding
				conveyed with crystal clarity that BP was not an oil company.
				They were an energy company.</p> <p class="svelte-q6hi1k">With public awareness of global warming on the rise, companies
				like BP were caught in a bind between the interests of
				shareholders and the broader public. Customers who paid BP to
				put their petrol in cars were pressuring the company to reduce
				emissions, while shareholders wanted nothing less than expensive
				changes that would harm dividends. The default response for most
				oil brands was to stall; deny the science, rebuke claims that
				they were a big cause of pollution and wait until the whole
				thing blew over. BP cleverly realised that climate denial was
				not the foolproof plan it was cracked up to be. Denying their
				role in the changing climate wasn’t going to win business from
				climate denialists, who already had no issue with them, but it
				would certainly turn climate conscious customers against them.
				While doing nothing about this new reputational risk was not an
				option, denial was a path could potentially do more damage than
				good. In recognising this, BP had a unique opportunity in the
				oil industry. They could break the view they were another
				company putting profit over the greater good. In 2000, with a
				price tag over $200 million, they announced their next move;
				they would be the first oil company in history to “go green”.</p> <p class="svelte-q6hi1k">BPs transformation resonated with the state of consumer
				sentiment at the time, famously captured in 2008 by George
				Maso's study which identified six segments of the public,
				differentiated in how they felt about climate change. Most fell
				into the “Alarmed”, “Concerned” and “Cautious” categories; not
				opposed to action but unclear on causes or solutions. This lack
				of technical understanding in the public gave strength to BPs
				optics driven approach, since it gave the public the impression
				they were a different kind of business; breaking the corporate
				mould and taking action where it counts.</p> <figure class="bar-chart svelte-q6hi1k"><figcaption class="caption lead svelte-q6hi1k">Most people wanted to see something done about climate
					change without having a clear understanding of the science.</figcaption> <figcaption class="caption subcaption svelte-q6hi1k">A 2008 study by George Mason’s found that consumers were

					understanding of the true drivers behind it.</figcaption> <img alt="Bar chart of climate awareness increasing in the 2000s" class="bar-chart-img svelte-q6hi1k"></figure> <p class="svelte-q6hi1k">While other companies would flounder against the rising wave of
				climate science, BPs campaign was designed to benefit from it.
				They were the first in the oil industry to openly acknowledge
				climate change and, by 2000, the world’s largest producer of
				solar panels . As a company emerging in several global markets,
				it was this image that left a first impression in many future
				customers minds . Later, after the billboards and brightly lit
				petrol stations had reached across the globe, surveys found that
				consumers saw BP as “the most environmentally friendly oil
				company”</p> <h2 class="svelte-q6hi1k">Not Beyond Credibility</h2> <p class="svelte-q6hi1k">Rigid reliance on climate denial to avoid accountability saw
				companies such as Exxon Mobile become the face of climate
				destruction, despite their impact ostensibly being identical to
				that of BP. Indeed, BPs green façade betrayed the fact they had taken little real action to curb their emissions. Whilst
				carefully assembling its green marketing campaign, BP had
				quietly been laser-focused on reducing overhead expenses, even
				at the cost of necessary quality and safety protocols. Whilst
				initially contained, these oversights soon began to compound,
				culminating in a series of dramatic events that would shake the
				firm to its core and cause the Beyond Petroleum campaign to be
				prematurely retired.</p> <p class="svelte-q6hi1k">The reasoning behind BPs marketing shift isn’t completely
				obvious. For one, the large media controversy surrounding them
				in the second half of the 2000s may have been mitigated if they
				hadn’t been parading around in environmentalist get up. What’s
				more, retail BPs petrol stations made up about 5% of total
				revenue at the time. While this is significant, it isn’t worth
				recreating your entire image to appease the customers using
				those stations. One reason was that “beyond petroleum” had the
				potential to convince regulators and the broader public that
				they could be trusted to operate without restrictive protective
				regulation that would stall activity and harm profits. It was
				clear now that public support for climate change was real, which
				would sooner or later become a force for legislative change. BP
				aimed to show they had intent to be a responsible corporate
				citizen who could behave well on their own.</p> <figure class="svelte-q6hi1k"><img alt="The progression of BPs logo since the 1960s" class="campaign-image svelte-q6hi1k"> <figcaption>The progression of BP's logo since the 1960s (1000 Logos)</figcaption></figure> <figure class="svelte-q6hi1k"><img alt="BP's Advertising Campaign" class="campaign-image svelte-q6hi1k"> <figcaption>BP's 'green' campaign from 2005 (source: BP)</figcaption></figure></div></div></section> <div class="content-container svelte-q6hi1k"><section id="s-origins" class="svelte-q6hi1k"><div class="makeover-paragraph svelte-q6hi1k"><h2 class="svelte-q6hi1k">How the Carbon Footprint Changed How You Think About Climate
				Change</h2> <div class="paragraph-2 svelte-q6hi1k"><p class="svelte-q6hi1k">For companies like BP, the carbon footprint calculator was
					not a tool to empower users, but rather a PR strategy to
					redirect attention to consumer emissions whilst bolstering
					their climate friendly image. Consumers, feeling the
					pressure of climate anxiety, were keen to take action on
					global warming. By providing a micro breakdown of
					individuals emissions, carbon footprint calculators like BPs
					satiated this desire whilst simultaneously raising the
					profile of consumer’s role in climate change. BPs website
					featured an online carbon footprint calculator, through
					which users could input lifestyle data, calculate their
					annual emissions, and pledge to reduce them. The calculator
					helped BP to reframe itself as an ally of the climate
					movement by providing tools which ostensibly helped reduce
					emissions, while pushing responsibility for emissions down
					the supply chain onto end users. The chart below illustrates
					how this consumer-focused framing distorts our understanding
					of climate responsibility—creating tunnel vision that
					overlooks the bigger picture.</p> <figure class="svelte-q6hi1k"><div id="lottie-animation" class="svelte-q6hi1k"></div> <figcaption class="caption-1">Click on the chart to see your <br> emissions in

					societies emissions aims to channel resources into
					unproductive individual efforts which lack the power to
					create real change. This narrative stands on two key
					misconceptions which have paved the way for companies to
					shift climate guilt onto individuals.</p> <p class="svelte-q6hi1k">The first misconception is that emissions are primarily
					caused by individuals consuming goods and services. To
					understand why, it helps to be familiar the three types of
					emissions in carbon accounting; scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3
					emissions. Scope 1 represents direct emissions output by
					company activities such as using diesel powered machinery.
					Scope 3 emissions are those which occur in the value chain
					of a companies activities, but are not directly caused by
					the company, including emissions from end users. Contrary to
					this misconception, climate reports have consistently shown
					that company's direct emissions eclipse emissions from end
					users, even for business with disproportionately large scope
					3 emissions. This means that, for an oil company, more
					emissions are produced extracting the oil and transporting
					it to your car than you do through driving it. This simple
					misunderstanding can reshape the way individuals view
					climate change and reinforces why transparent corporate
					emissions reporting is essential to building a clear picture
					of climate change in society.</p> <p class="svelte-q6hi1k">The second key misconception is that emissions reductions
					are always possible through lifestyle choices. Substitute
					goods with lower environmental impact are not always
					available or affordable to consumers. Moreover, the actions
					with the potential to make the largest impact often involve
					abstaining from certain purchases and activities altogether
					to reduce emissions, which can restrict access to
					opportunities, essential goods, and services. The three
					actions with the largest potential to decrease individual
					emissions are abstention living car free, taking fewer
					long-haul flights and having fewer children. While these may
					be viable options to some, it can be difficult to make such
					sacrifices in the face of financial pressures. Were such
					changes to be adopted by individuals at scale, it would be
					disastrous for economic productivity and wellbeing. These
					barriers facing consumers trying to reduce consumption or
					choose green alternatives decreases the likelihood of this
					solution being adopted at scale. Clearing up these
					misconceptions provides clarity and will help us to view
					climate change in terms of its true causes.</p></div></div></section></div>`,1);function fe(L,H){U(H,!1);let y=S(!1);I(()=>{const e=document.querySelector(".title");if(e){const c=e.getBoundingClientRect().top,n=window.innerHeight;c<n*.75&&M(y,!0)}const s=()=>{const c=document.querySelectorAll(".fadein-scroll"),n=new Set;c.forEach((h,se)=>{if(n.has(h))return;const O=h.getBoundingClientRect().top,V=window.innerHeight;O<V*.5&&(h.classList.add("visible"),n.add(h),n.size===c.length&&window.removeEventListener("scroll",s))})};return window.addEventListener("scroll",s),s(),()=>{window.removeEventListener("scroll",s)}});let o=S(null),p;I(async()=>{if(typeof window<"u"&&(p=(await z(()=>import("../chunks/CvEQ06TD.js").then(s=>s.l),[],import.meta.url)).default),p&&r(o)){const e=p.loadAnimation({container:r(o),renderer:"svg",loop:!1,autoplay:!1,path:`${l}/perspective-v2.json`});e.setSpeed(.6),r(o).addEventListener("click",()=>{(e.isPaused||e.currentFrame===0)&&e.play()}),e.addEventListener("complete",()=>{e.playDirection===1?(e.goToAndStop(e.totalFrames,!0),e.setDirection(-1)):e.playDirection===-1&&e.setDirection(1)})}}),ie();var k=ae(),m=Y(k),q=i(m),g=i(q),$=i(g);t(g);var B=a(g,2),D=i(B);te(D,{}),t(B),t(q),t(m);var f=a(m,4),P=i(f),T=i(P),v=a(i(T),2),F=a(i(v),4);u(F,"src",`${l??""}/colchart-climateawareness.png`),t(v);var w=a(v,8),R=a(i(w),4);u(R,"src",`${l??""}/six-americas.png`),t(w);var b=a(w,10),j=i(b);u(j,"src",`${l??""}/BP-Logo-history.jpg`),d(2),t(b);var _=a(b,2),G=i(_);u(G,"src",`${l??""}/bp-cf-ads.jpg`),d(2),t(_),t(T),t(P),t(f);var C=a(f,2),A=i(C),x=i(A),E=a(i(x),2),W=a(i(E),2),N=i(W);ee(N,e=>M(o,e),()=>r(o)),d(2),t(W),t(E),d(4),t(x),t(A),t(C),Q(()=>Z($,`title ${(r(y)?"visible":"")??""} svelte-q6hi1k`)),J(L,k),X()}export{fe as component};
