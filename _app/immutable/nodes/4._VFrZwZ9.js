				Support from huge celebrities (Leo Dicaprio and Sting each set
				up environmental foundations during this time) gave the movement
				culture cache, and the topic quickly penetrated the Overton
				window. In the '90s, Michael Jacksons music video for “Earth
				Song” had a cultural moment, with its dramatic imagery of wind
				machines blowing his hair and clothes. Public awareness of the
				issue led extreme weather events to be associated with the
				greenhouse effect, further elevating its profile in public
				discussion. Droughts across the US in 1988, and a
				record-breaking El Niño in 1998 aroused fear that natural
				disasters were being influenced by “man-made” factors. By the
				turn of the millennium, fear of an impending climate crisis was
				reaching all time highs.</p> <figure class="bar-chart svelte-1j1ryzm"><figcaption class="caption lead svelte-1j1ryzm">Most people heard about climate change for the first time in

				their vibe. Their visual brand transformed into a kaleidoscope
				of green and yellow hues. They parted with the staunch, blocky
				aesthetic of the oil industry, and replaced their tagline -
				'British Petroleum' - with 'Beyond Petroleum'. Their theatrical
				new branding conveyed one idea with crystal clarity: BP wasn't
				like the other oil companies. Ads like the one below, which
				shows a car full of babies drive past several derelict gas
				stations in search of somewhere to fill up their car, reaffirmed
				this idea. No prizes for guessing which station they end up
				choosing.</p> <figure class="svelte-1j1ryzm"><img alt="BP video ad"> <figcaption>BP's "Babies" TV ad was aired in 2007.</figcaption></figure> <div class="old_logo_container svelte-1j1ryzm"><figure class="svelte-1j1ryzm"><img class="old_logo svelte-1j1ryzm" alt="BPs old logo prior to rebrand"> <figcaption>BP's logo prior to 1997 had none of the floral
						connotations of the logo that would replace it.</figcaption></figure></div> <p class="svelte-1j1ryzm">BPs campaign was talking to the growing segment of the
				population that saw fossil fuel companies as directly
				accountable for the greenhouse effect. However, while customers
				were pressuring the company to reduce emissions, shareholders
				were wary of green changes that would harm profits. The default
				response for most oil brands was to stall; deny the science,
				rebuke claims that they were causing pollution and hold out
				until people forgot all about it.</p> <p class="svelte-1j1ryzm">BP realised that this strategy was deeply flawed. Denying their
				role in climate change would only harm their popularity with
				climate conscious customers, who would be key to turning the
				tide of public opinion in their direction. Instead, they would
				embody what the people wanted, an oil business moving “Beyond
				Petroleum”.</p> <p class="svelte-1j1ryzm">BP’s transformation resonated with consumers who were yet to
				understand climate change fully, but still felt strongly about
				it. A study in 2008 found most consumers could be categorised as
				“Alarmed”, “Concerned” or “Cautious” regarding global warming;
				supportive of action, but unclear on causes or solutions. This
				lack of technical understanding gave strength to BP’s
				optics-driven approach, espousing the impression they were
				cutting back on damaging behaviour in response to public calls
				for change.</p> <figure class="bar-chart svelte-1j1ryzm"><figcaption class="caption lead svelte-1j1ryzm">Most people wanted to see something done about climate
					change without having a clear understanding of the science.</figcaption> <figcaption class="caption subcaption svelte-1j1ryzm">Leiserowitz's "Six Americas" study (2008) found that

				climate science, BP’s campaign was designed to profit from it.
				BP was the first in the oil industry to openly acknowledge
				climate change and, by 2000, the world’s largest producer of
				solar panels. In 2005, Australia’s then Federal Industry
				Minister Ian Macfarlane showed endorsement for BP’s green
				practices by announcing his $100m Renewable Energy Development
				Initiative at their solar factory in Sydney. As a company
				emerging in several global markets, it was this green image of
				BP that left a first impression in many future customers' minds.
				Later, after billboards and brightly lit petrol stations had
				made their way across the globe, surveys found that consumers
				viewed BP as “the most environmentally friendly oil company”.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1j1ryzm">Beyond the theatrics</h2> <p class="svelte-1j1ryzm"></p> <p class="svelte-1j1ryzm">While BP had become a dark horse of the green marketing world,
				their façade betrayed a darker reality in their operations.
				Behind the scenes, BP had quietly been laser-focused on reducing
				overhead. The resulting strategy was one of blatant cost cutting
				negligence concealed by a pro-environment veneer. Whilst initially
				contained, these oversights soon began to compound, culminating
				in a series of dramatic incidents that would shake the firms
				green identity to its core.</p> <p class="svelte-1j1ryzm">In 2005, a distillation tower at the Texas City oil refinery was
				restarted after planned maintanence. What the operators hadn't
				realised is that the tower had failed to be fitted with
				necessary drainage equipment. Overfilled beyond its limits, the
				tower ignited into an enormous explosion that claimed 15 lives.
				A year later, in 2006, it was reported that BPs Prudhoe Bay oil
				pipeline had been leaking extensively into the Alaskan
				wilderness. The final moments of BP’s “Beyond Petroleum” alter
				ego were marked by the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform
				explosion in 2010, resulting in the largest marine oil spill in
				human history.</p> <p class="svelte-1j1ryzm">The failure of BP’s campaign offers insight into the power of
				strategic narrative when cultural and scientific understanding
				of an issue are yet to align. By presenting itself as a company
				that had moved "Beyond Petroleum," BP captured the aspirations
				of a public increasingly aware of climate risks, yet uncertain
				about how change would materialise. Instead of challenging the
				public’s assumptions, BP affirmed them. In doing so, they
				constructed a powerful illusion that deferred scrutiny and
				allowed harmful practices to continue beneath a carefully
				manicured exterior.</p> <h3 class="references svelte-1j1ryzm">References</h3> <p class="svelte-1j1ryzm">1) Nisbet, M. C., & Myers, T. A. (2007). The polls–trends:
