Keep scrolling to find out.</p> <p class="lead svelte-9i06l3">In 2004, British Petroleum, one of the largest owned oil companies worldwide, hired public relations professionals Ogilvy & Mather to promote the idea that climate change is not the fault of large corporations, but that of individuals.</p> <p class="lead svelte-9i06l3">This initiative proved wildly successful, altering the way we view climate change in the 21st century.</p></div></div></div></section> <div class="content-container"><section id="campaign" class="svelte-9i06l3"><h2 class="svelte-9i06l3">A Campaign to Change the Way We Think</h2> <div class="content-box-2 svelte-9i06l3"><div class="paragraph-2 svelte-9i06l3"><p class="svelte-9i06l3">At the start of the new millennia there was a growing expectation that it was time to begin fighting the effects of climate change. Public perceptions of the threat of climate change had increased due to devastating natural disasters such as the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami with a quarter of a million casualties. Seminal publications such as the Stern report also raised awareness by highlighting the negative economic consequences of climate change.</p> <p class="svelte-9i06l3">Companies tied to carbon emitting practices found themselves in a difficult position where the public actually cared about their damaging behaviors. This was bad for business, but the secondary effects of such a shift were significant as well. Greater public interest in climate change could pressure politicians into policy reforms aimed at restricting emissions.</p> <p class="svelte-9i06l3">The reality was that without some intervention, corporate emitters were looking at an existential threat. Over the following years, numerous campaigns sprung up with the aim of redirecting public climate anxiety in a new direction.</p> <p class="svelte-9i06l3">The carbon footprint was an idea borne from this movement to distract from corporate environmental damaging by encourage people to view emissions in terms of their everyday choices such as diet, transport and overseas travel.</p></div> <div class="pictures-2 svelte-9i06l3"><figure class="svelte-9i06l3"><img alt="BP's Advertising Campaign" class="campaign-image svelte-9i06l3"> <figcaption>The original BP carbon campaign from 2005 (source: XXX)</figcaption></figure> <figure class="svelte-9i06l3"><img alt="Early Carbon Footprint Calculator" class="campaign-image calc svelte-9i06l3"> <figcaption>An early carbon footprint calculator (source: soft112)</figcaption></figure></div></div></section></div> <section id="perspective" class="svelte-9i06l3"><div class="perspective svelte-9i06l3">Putting Emissions Back in Perspective</div> <div class="content-container"><div class="content-box-2 svelte-9i06l3"><div class="paragraph-2 light wht-brdr svelte-9i06l3"><p class="svelte-9i06l3">With a lack of accurate information, our collective sense of where climate change comes from has been distorted.</p> <p class="svelte-9i06l3">The overwhelming sense of powerlessness and other negative emotions that come from taking individual responsibility drive individuals toward climate denial.</p> <p class="svelte-9i06l3">The reality is that individuals' actions are important.
