				Support from huge celebrities (Leo Dicaprio and Sting each set
				up environmental foundations during this time) gave the movement
				culture cache, and the topic quickly entered the Overton window.
				Michael Jacksons music video for “Earth Song”, with its dramatic
				imagery of wind machines blowing Jackson's hair and clothes, had
				a cultural moment in the 1990s. Al Gore, a pro-environmental
				figurehead, achieved the popular vote for the US presidency in
				2000 as public support for climate positive change swelled.
				Public awareness led extreme weather events to be associated
				with the greenhouse effect for the first time, further elevating
				its profile in public discussion. Extreme droughts across the US
				in 1988, and a global record-breaking El Niño in 1998 were
				feared to be influenced by “man-made” factors. The cultural
				momentum of climate change captivated the public which would
				soon become eager to hold corporations responsible for their
				role.</p> <figure class="bar-chart svelte-q6hi1k"><figcaption class="caption lead svelte-q6hi1k">Most people heard about climate change for the first time in

				their vibe. Their visual brand transformed into a cacophony of
				green and yellow hues and soft, lowercase font. They adopted a
				new logo resembling a shining sun, drastically out of step with
				the staunch, blocky logos of its oil peers, and parted with
				their long-time name British Petroleum, in favour of Beyond
				Petroleum. Their theatrical new branding conveyed one idea with
				crystal clarity: BP was no longer an oil company.</p> <p class="svelte-q6hi1k">BPs campaign was in response to the growing sentiment among
				everyday people that fossil fuel companies were primely
				responsible for the degradation of the climate. However, while
				customers were pressuring the company to reduce emissions,
				shareholders were wary of green changes that would harm profits.
				The default response for most oil brands was to stall; deny the
				science, rebuke claims that they were causing pollution and hold
				out until people forgot all about it.</p> <p class="svelte-q6hi1k">BP cleverly realised that climate denial was not the foolproof
				plan it was cracked up to be. Denying the impact of wasn’t going
				to win business from climate denialists, who were already
				impartial to their business. However, it would harm their favour
				with climate conscious customers, who would be key to turning
				the tides of their predicament. Recognising this, BP had an
				opportunity that was unique to them in the oil industry. They
				could put a stop to the idea that they were yet another company
				putting profit over the greater good. In 2000, with a price tag
				over $200 million, they announced their next move: they would be
				the first oil company in history to "go green".</p> <p class="svelte-q6hi1k">BPs campaign was a response to the growing sentiment among

				sentiment at the time . Most fell into the categories of
				“Alarmed”, “Concerned” or “Cautious” regarding global warming;
				not opposed to action, but unclear on causes or solutions. This
				lack of technical understanding gave strength to BP’s
				optics-driven approach, since it gave the impression they were
				responding to public calls for change through taking real action
				to cut back on damaging activities.</p> <p class="svelte-q6hi1k">While other companies would flounder against the rising wave of
				climate science, BP’s campaign was designed to profit from it.
				BP was the first in the oil industry to openly acknowledge
				climate change and, by 2000, the world’s largest producer of
				solar panels. As a company emerging in several global markets,
				it was this image that left a first impression in many future
				customers' minds. Later, after the billboards and brightly lit
				petrol stations had reached across the globe, surveys found that
				consumers saw BP as “the most environmentally friendly oil
				company”.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q6hi1k">Not Beyond Credibility</h2> <p class="svelte-q6hi1k">Rigid reliance on climate denial to avoid accountability saw
				companies such as Exxon Mobile become the face of climate
				destruction, despite their impact ostensibly being identical to
				that of BP. Indeed, BPs green façade betrayed the fact they had
				taken little real action to curb their emissions. Whilst
				carefully assembling its green marketing campaign, BP had
				quietly been laser-focused on reducing overhead expenses, even
				at the cost of necessary quality and safety protocols. Whilst
				initially contained, these oversights soon began to compound,
				culminating in a series of dramatic events that would shake the
				firm to its core and cause the Beyond Petroleum campaign to be
				prematurely retired.</p> <p class="svelte-q6hi1k">In 2005, a distillation tower at the Texas City oil refinery 
				was restarted after planned maintanence. What the operators didn't 
				know is that the tower had failed to be fitted with the necessary 
				drainage equipment, and overfilled with oil it quickly caught aflame, 
				igniting an enormous explosion that claimed 15 lives. A year later, in
				2006, it was reported that their Prudhoe Bay oil pipeline had
				been leaking extensively into the Alaskan wilderness. The final
				moments of BP’s “Beyond Petroleum” alter ego was marked by the
				Deepwater Horizon drilling platform explosion in 2010, resulting
				in the largest marine oil spill in human history.</p></div></div></section>`,1);function oe(P,_){D(_,!1);let u=V(!1);B(()=>{const d=document.querySelector(".title");if(d){const s=d.getBoundingClientRect().top,o=window.innerHeight;s<o*.75&&N(u,!0)}const a=()=>{const s=document.querySelectorAll(".fadein-scroll"),o=new Set;s.forEach((n,j)=>{if(o.has(n))return;const M=n.getBoundingClientRect().top,S=window.innerHeight;M<S*.5&&(n.classList.add("visible"),o.add(n),o.size===s.length&&window.removeEventListener("scroll",a))})};return window.addEventListener("scroll",a),a(),()=>{window.removeEventListener("scroll",a)}}),B(async()=>{typeof window<"u"&&(await C(()=>import("../chunks/CvEQ06TD.js").then(a=>a.l),[],import.meta.url)).default}),J();var g=U(),r=R(g),f=e(r),l=e(f),T=e(l);t(l);var v=i(l,2),x=e(v);O(x,{}),t(v),t(f),t(r);var w=i(r,4),y=e(w),b=e(y),c=i(e(b),2),A=i(e(c),4);m(A,"src",`${p??""}/colchart-climateawareness.png`),t(c);var h=i(c,10),E=i(e(h),4);m(E,"src",`${p??""}/six-americas.png`),t(h);var k=i(h,4),H=e(k);m(H,"src",`${p??""}/BP_baby_ad.gif`),q(2),t(k),q(10),t(b),t(y),t(w),W(()=>G(T,`title ${(z(u)?"visible":"")??""} svelte-q6hi1k`)),I(P,g),$()}export{oe as component};
