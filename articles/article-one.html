				the idea that addressing individuals ‘carbon footprint’ is an

				traction. This raises the question - why do we frame this
				enormously complex problem, whose causes are entrenched in all
				areas of society, in terms of the simple decisions we make each
				day?</p> <p class="lead svelte-jbdfml">In this article, the downstream project will explore the main
				reasons motivating an increased emphasis on individual

				intuitive concept. Every day we take part in various actions
				that result in a greater amount of carbon emissions being
				released into the atmosphere than if we were to abstain from
				them. Using various tools, we can calculate the total sum of
				such emissions, our ‘footprint’, and learn about the ways we
				might reduce that number. This simplicity, grounded in terms of
				the daily activities we understand well, made the carbon
				footprint a massive hit. However, there is more to this story
				than meets the eye.</p> <p class="svelte-jbdfml">One often overlooked aspect of the ‘carbon footprint’ is that
				not all emissions are made equal. Your carbon footprint includes
				emissions created both directly and indirectly through your
				actions. This seemingly minor distinction is an important piece
				of context required to fully grasp what your carbon footprint is
				really telling you. To understand this better, it is useful to
				understand the idea of scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions,
				labels used to distinguish between direct and indirect sources
				of emissions.</p> <p class="svelte-jbdfml"><span class="bold svelte-jbdfml">Scope 1</span> emissions refer to emissions created
				directly through a company’s activities using its own assets. For
				example, the scope 1 emissions of a mining company include the emissions
				from combusting diesel to power large trucks used to transport rubble
				and heavy machinery used for excavation.</p> <p class="svelte-jbdfml"><span class="bold svelte-jbdfml">Scope 2</span> emissions are produced indirectly
				as a result of electricity purchased by the company. For instance,
				a law firm generates scope 2 emissions when coal plants produce the
				electricity which is purchased and used in its head office.</p> <p class="svelte-jbdfml"><span class="bold svelte-jbdfml">Scope 3</span> emissions are emissions produced
				as a result of the company’s business by assets or sources that the
				company does not directly own or control. Using the example of a
				car company, scope 3 emissions include the exhaust from people driving
				the cars they produce, as well as the greenhouse gasses emitted by
				steel factories that manufacture intermediate goods for their cars.</p> <p class="svelte-jbdfml">In the world of corporate policy, scope 3 emissions are rarely
				treated as seriously as scope 1 and 2 emissions, for two
				reasons. Firstly, tracing the chain of causality from a company
				to its scope 3 emissions is exponentially more difficult than
				for other scope 1 or scope 2 emissions. Unlike scope 3
				emissions, scope 1 emissions occur on company soil, or result
				from activities directly undertaken by the company, so there is
				no question that they caused them. Scope 2 emissions are also
				easy to assign to specific companies, since invoices can show
				exactly how much electricity they have consumed. On the other
				hand, scope 3 emissions occur off site, and are created by a
				multitude of parties, making them harder to account for.</p> <p class="svelte-jbdfml">Secondly, a company does not necessarily have the authority to
				halt the activities that cause their scope 3 emissions to be
				released into the atmosphere. Even if we are sure that a
				particular service a company procured caused emissions to be
				output into the atmosphere, it may be unclear if those emissions
				would have been created if the service was not used by that
				company. For instance, imagine a company whose scope 3 emissions
				include services from a cargo plane company delivering
				intermediate products to their facilities. Since cargo planes
				carry goods for multiple businesses, it’s hard to show that the
				plane wouldn’t have flown with the remainder of the cargo were
				that company to withdraw from using their services. As a result,
				accountability for businesses’ scope 3 emissions is limited, and
				relies on firms taking voluntary action to reduce or offset
				their scope 3 emissions.</p> <p class="svelte-jbdfml">To use an analogy, we can think of the emissions created in
				different stages of the lifecycle of a product as water flowing
				down a river.</p></div></div> <div class="scroll-animation-container outer-container svelte-jbdfml"><div class="labels label-left svelte-jbdfml"><div class="scope s1 svelte-jbdfml"><div class="highlight-font darken-2 svelte-jbdfml">Scope 1</div> <p class="tile-description svelte-jbdfml">Emissions released into the atmosphere as a direct result of

Optics</h2> <div class="paragraph-2 svelte-jbdfml"><p class="svelte-jbdfml">In 2004, BP’s marketing underwent a remarkable
					transformation. The oil behemoth ditched its dated BP-crest
					logo for a green flower, adopted the tagline “Beyond
					Petroleum”, and featured adverts in major newspapers which
					prompted readers to <span class="italic svelte-jbdfml">“Find out the size of your household’s carbon
						footprint, learn how you can reduce it, and see how
						we’re reducing ours at bp.com”.</span> At the heart of this overhaul was BP’s “carbon footprint calculator”.
					The concept was simple: people could go online, enter details
					about their daily activities into the calculator (driving, electricity
					use, flights, etc.), and it calculates their personal annual
					carbon emissions for them. But why was BP, an almost 100-year-old
					company, suddenly conducting a drastic rebrand?</p> <figure class="svelte-jbdfml"><img src="../BP-Logo-history.jpg" alt="The progression of BPs logo since the 1960s" class="campaign-image calc svelte-jbdfml"> <figcaption>The progression of BP's logo since the 1960s (1000
						Logos)</figcaption></figure> <p class="svelte-jbdfml">BP’s rebrand aimed to capture public good-will by
					capitalising on the social climate. In the last two decades,
					BP had undergone rapid growth on the back of a series of
					acquisitions, including the fifth largest oil company in the
					US at the time. BP had also been struggling with public
					relations on multiple fronts. Public consensus on climate
					change was now growing, causing the company to draw
					increased criticism from potential customers. Additionally,
					successive scandals at its facilities resulting from poor
					safety standards made BP seem reckless and inhumane. As a
					company which was new presence in many markets, BP
					capitalised on the opportunity to reinvent itself with a
					new, green image. Oglivy &amp; Mather, the marketing agency
					behind the rebrand, described the campaign as BP reinventing
					itself “as an energy company people can have faith in”. The
					public reception wasn’t perfect, inspiring scepticism in
					some groups due to BPs misdoings being a recent memory. Here
					is an excerpt from a 2006 article from the NYT “Walking
					through an airport earlier this week, I happened to spot a
					BP advertisement. You know the kind I’m talking about: the
					letters BP in lower-case type — making them somehow warmer
					and fuzzier — above a yellow and green sun, and the words
					“beyond petroleum.” Like most BP ads, indeed, like virtually
					all BP marketing, it spoke to the company’s commitment to
					the environment”. Despite the cynicism evident in the
					authors tone, they capture the effect of BPs new marketing
					well. For those without the time or resources to know the
					company’s true character, BPs marketing would likely strike
					the intended chord - signalling that they were the oil
					company of the 21st century. The carbon footprint
					calculator, an emblem of holding the public responsible for
					private companies’ actions, was to be the flagship offering
					of this new identity.</p> <figure class="svelte-jbdfml"><iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ywrZPypqSB4" title="BP Ad: Carbon Footprint" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure> <p class="svelte-jbdfml">From start to finish, BPs rebrand was a masterclass in
					obfuscation. Whilst they boldly paraded around their image
					as a friend of the environment, almost nothing about their
					operations had changed. They had realised that public
					opinion of their highly polluting activities, at least in
					the short term, was a game of optics. If they could convince
					the public that the biggest emitters cared about the
					environment, and had it handled, then what reason did they
					have to worry about it?</p> <p class="svelte-jbdfml">The carbon footprint calculator, which BP began
					pushingthrough promotional material around this time, was
					thecentrepiece of the campaign. By encouraging individuals
					tomeasure their own emissions, BP’s messaging implied
					thatclimate change was the result of personal choices.
					Throughadverts and rebranding they silently pushed the
					message“That’s right, I’m doing my part. Are you?”. They
					were earlyto the party, too. BP's then chi'ef executive
					Lorde Browne wasthe first oil executive to announce that
					climate change wasa real issue (shocker), and that oil
					companies had toaddress in a speech at Stanford in 1999.
					While most otherpolluting companies were still firmly in the
					category ofclimate denial, which had worked so far, BP was a
					first moverof the greenwashing movement. Greenwashing is the
					act ofcreating the image of being an environmentally
					consciouscompany without intending to actually change your
					harmfulactions, "washing" them using PR tactics. Because of
					this, BP got toreap the rewards in the form of social
					currency. Peoplewanted to buy messaging about a company
					taking thethe action they wanted to see in the corporate
					world. Thecarbon footprint calculator itself was especially
					hard todiscredit, being an actual tool for people trying
					todecrease their emissions. By allowing people to
					quantifytheir personal contributions to climate change, they
					werehelping people to set goals to make improvements and
					measurethe results.</p> <figure class="svelte-jbdfml"><img src="../bp-cf-ads.jpg" alt="BP's Advertising Campaign" class="campaign-image svelte-jbdfml"> <figcaption>BP's 'green' campaign from 2005 (source: BP)</figcaption></figure> <p class="svelte-jbdfml">Climate scientists observed that this move was part of a
					broader shift in tactics by fossil fuel interests from
					outright climate science denial to a technique called
					“deflection”. Deflection is when an actor is seeking to
					challenge a narrative in public discourse, and instead of
					outright denying it, seems to agree, while serving up a
					slightly altered version of events to an unassuming
					audience. BP’s massive PR campaign not only places the
					burden of responsibility on consumers, but alleviates
					corporate polluters. Instead of being seen as one of the
					worst perpetrators of environmental havoc, now they were <span class="italic svelte-jbdfml">“trying to make a difference”</span>.
					This positioned the company as doing their part by providing
					tools and encouragement, despite their core business still
					being overwhelmingly in high emissions activities.</p> <figure class="svelte-jbdfml"><img src="../bp-boardroom.jpg" alt="Chief scientist at BP presenting on the energy transition" class="campaign-image calc svelte-jbdfml"> <figcaption>BP's chief scientist presenting on the energy transition

Consumer Behaviour</h2> <div class="paragraph-2 svelte-jbdfml"><p class="svelte-jbdfml">While the carbon footprint concept has its origins in
					corporate deflection—exemplified by BP’s 2004 marketing
					campaign—its persistence in public discourse is not purely
					the result of manipulative corporate tactics. In fact, part
					of what made the idea so enduring was its resonance with a
					growing awareness that climate change demands not only
					structural reform, but also widespread participation. The
					appeal of individual carbon accounting lies in its offer of
					agency: an accessible entry point for ordinary people to
					engage with an otherwise overwhelming problem.</p> <figure class="svelte-jbdfml"><img src="../cfc-screenshot.jpg" alt="The progression of BPs logo since the 1960s" class="campaign-image calc svelte-jbdfml"> <figcaption>A carbon footprint calculator from the 2000s (Source:)</figcaption></figure> <p class="svelte-jbdfml">Although climate science is unequivocal that most emissions
					stem from large industrial actors, research has shown that
					individual and household-level behaviours can cumulatively
					influence system-wide outcomes through market signals and
					democratic pressure. Although hard to coordinate, a change
					in consumer preferences can effectively signal to businesses
					a desire for more eco-friendly products and services.</p> <p class="svelte-jbdfml">The carbon footprint also helped to normalise environmental
					thinking in everyday life. By placing emissions at the level
					of personal consumption, it engaged a broad public in
					climate discourse in a way few policy frameworks could. Over
					the past two decades, pressure from environmentally
					conscious consumers has become a recognised force in
					corporate governance, particularly within ESG
					(Environmental, Social, and Governance) frameworks. A 2020
					review by Amel-Zadeh and Serafeim in Journal of Economic
					Perspectives found that reputational concerns and investor
					preferences—both shaped by public awareness—are now major
					factors that can influence firms' bottom line.</p> <p class="svelte-jbdfml">The carbon footprint was never a sufficient frame for
					understanding climate change. But, in helping to cultivate a
					culture of environmental accountability, it opened up a
					space for discussions around consumer behaviour and
					corporate responsibility. While individuals may not be able
					to significantly reduce emissions through their actions,
					they can lead by example, and influence others to think more
					critically about what activities and organisations are most
					responsible for climate change.</p></div></div></section> <section id="s-makeover" class="svelte-jbdfml"><div class="makeover-paragraph svelte-jbdfml"><h2 class="svelte-jbdfml">What does the Data Say?</h2> <div class="paragraph-2 svelte-jbdfml"><p class="svelte-jbdfml">If everyone is responsible for their carbon footprint, how
					big are those footprints really? How do they compare to the
					carbon pollution emitted by large fossil fuel companies? The
					data overwhelmingly show the emissions output of
					individuals, even in high-income countries, are a fraction
					of corporate carbon footprints. In Australia – which has one
					of the highest per-capita carbon footprints – the average
					person’s activities produce about 15.4 tons of CO₂ per year.
					Multiplying that by almost 27 million Australians yields
					415.8 million tons – which is significant. Bewilderingly,
					that is a only 5.6% of the 7.4 billion tonnes of CO₂
					produced by just 5 entities in 2023. This underscores that
					the increase in CO₂ concentrations in the atmosphere over
					the last 40 years is driven by industrial activity and
					energy production choices, not lifestyle choices. As experts
					have pointed out, the real levers with the power to make
					change – systemic factors like how electricity is generated,
					how goods are produced, and what policies govern energy use
					– are influenced by corporate and governmental control far
					more than any average person.</p> <p class="svelte-jbdfml">It is telling that even when individual behaviour changed
					dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic the drop in global
					CO₂ emissions was not significant – between 6-8% in 2020.
					The chart below shows the quarterly national emissions data
					for Australia, with the shaded area approximately covering
					the time affected by the pandemic. While there is a
					definitive slump in emissions evident during the pandemic,
					it is hardly on the order implied by the mantra that our
					“individual efforts make all the difference”. Moreover, the
					decrease in emissions during the pandemic represented part
					of a broader downward trend due to the decarbonisation of
					the grid, evident in the gradual shrinking of the blue
					‘electricity’ layer over time. All in all, the emissions
					impact of this society wide change in behaviour was nominal.</p></div></div> <figure class="annual-emissions-chart fadein-scroll svelte-jbdfml"><div class="annual-emissions-chart bg svelte-jbdfml"><img src="../annual-emissions-chart.jpg" alt="Annual Emissions in Australia" class="emissions-chart-img svelte-jbdfml"></div> <figcaption>Australia's annual emissions has decreased over time without
				real change in public behaviour (Source: National Greenhouse Gas
				Inventory: Quarterly updates)</figcaption></figure> <div class="makeover-paragraph svelte-jbdfml"><div class="paragraph-2 svelte-jbdfml"><p class="svelte-jbdfml">This demonstrates that since a large portion our personal
					carbon footprint is made up of emissions from third parties,
					we are limited in how much we can can do to decrease our
					emissions through personal action. This is because more
					drastic change requires changes to systems such as the grid,
					or the creation of infrastructure such as bike lanes.
					Electric grids are known as natural monopolies because it is
					inefficient to have multiple firms competing to supply the
					same areas with power. Instead, a few, highly regulated
					firms are typically given the task of supply power toa
					specific area. This means the emissions intensity of your
					power is not something you get to choose, outside of some
					alterations you make to your house, it is by virtue of where
					you live. For instance, between 2000 and 2023, the amount of
					CO₂ produced per unit of energy produced in Australia has
					decreased by 47%. This enormous improvement, which affects
					the carbon footprint of all Australians, had nothing to do
					with individual decision-making. Rather, it was brought
					about through placing pressure on those in power, targeted
					policy, changing cultural attitudes and coordinated efforts
					to add renewable generation to the grid.</p> <p class="svelte-jbdfml">Another similarly essential industry for life in the 21st
					century whose services are considered “emitting behaviours”
					by carbon footprint calculators is air travel. Air travel
					has such high barriers to entry that true competition is
					hard to come by, and it is a hard-to-abate sector. This
					means that, unlike some other industries, there are few
					commercially viable solutions to allow planes to fly without
					producing the amount of emissions they do currently. As a
					result, consumers have little choice but to contribute to
					emissions through participating in these systems, or lose
					out on access to this important service required for modern
					life, which is not realistic. It should be noted that the
					point here is not to show that we cannot make change or set
					a positive example for others by choosing to make
					sustainable decisions. It is the expectation that our
					personal decisions alone can make a tangible impact in
					fighting climate change that is deeply misguided.</p> <p class="svelte-jbdfml">There are certain sets of emissions we do have control over.
					Typically, these are Scope 1 emissions—the direct emissions
					from sources you own or control. This includes things like
					the fuel you burn in your personal vehicle, and emissions
					from gas heaters in your home, or any other combustion that
					happens under your direct ownership. These are the easiest
					to influence directly, since they are directly produced
					through your actions. Therefore, transitioning to electric
					vehicles, improving home insulation, or switching from gas
					to electric cooking can significantly reduce this category.
					Albeit, these changes do require an initial investment, so
					they may not always be an option. Other changes such as
					using public transport, or riding a bike to work can be both
					affordable and effective at reducing your personal impact,
					and can give some degree of satisfaction that you are
					contributing to limiting human impact on the environment.</p></div></div></section> <section id="s-makeover" class="svelte-jbdfml"><div class="makeover-paragraph svelte-jbdfml"><h2 class="svelte-jbdfml">Influence on Public Perception and Discourse</h2> <div class="paragraph-2 svelte-jbdfml"><p class="svelte-jbdfml">BP’s carbon footprint campaign and similar industry efforts
					have had a discernible impact on public perceptions of
					climate responsibility. The very fact that “carbon
					footprint” entered everyday vocabulary in the 2000s is
					testament to the campaign’s reach. Before BP’s push, the
					term was virtually non-existent in public discourse;
					afterwards, it became a centrepiece of climate
					conversations, educational programs, and even government
					advisories. Google search trends for “carbon footprint”
					spike after 2004, reflecting how quickly the concept caught
					on. Many people began meticulously tracking their personal
					carbon impacts – from switching light bulbs to calculating
					flight emissions – convinced that individual action was the
					paramount solution to climate change. Climate educators have
					noted how this focus can crowd out discussion of systemic
					action. Naomi Oreskes, the Harvard science historian, offers
					a telling anecdote: when giving public talks on climate
					change, she is almost invariably asked “What can I do,
					personally, to fix this problem?” far more often than she is
					asked about holding companies or governments accountable.
					This reflects a success of the fossil-fuel PR narrative: the
					public internalized the idea that personal lifestyle changes
					are the key to addressing climate change, while discussion
					of corporate responsibility or political action was
					comparatively muted. Indeed, Oreskes attributes that common
					sentiment in part to the marketing campaigns by BP, Exxon
					and others that relentlessly promoted personal carbon
					footprints.</p> <figure class="svelte-jbdfml"><img src="../carbon-fp-trend.png" alt="Google searches including the term carbon footprint shot up in the early 2000s" class="campaign-image trend svelte-jbdfml"> <figcaption>The number of Google searches including the term carbon

						Trends)</figcaption></figure> <p class="svelte-jbdfml">However, there are signs that society’s view of an
					individual-based approach to fighting climate change is
					increasingly dim. Social scientists and climate
					communicators have increasingly critiqued the over-emphasis
					on individual action as a form of “discursive manipulation”
					that can delay collective solutions. On social media, posts
					such as the one featured at the start of the article reflect
					the cultural shift. When a global company’s tweet
					encouraging climate action gets ratio’d by a no name account
					by a factor of 136, it is a sign that people no longer see
					empty climate platitudes from corporations through the same
					rose-tinted lens that they once did.</p> <p class="svelte-jbdfml">Environmental organizations now often stress balancing
					personal steps with systemic change – essentially
					re-educating the public that one cannot simply shop or
					recycle their way out of the climate crisis if policy and
					corporate practices remain unchanged. Importantly, public
					opinion is evolving: surveys indicate that people are
					increasingly aware of corporate culpability for climate
					change. A national survey in the United States (Yale, 2019)
					found that 57% of Americans believe fossil fuel companies
					have either “a great deal” or “a moderate amount” of
					responsibility for the damages caused by global warming. A
					similar majority supported requiring those companies to pay
					for a portion of climate damage costs. This suggests a shift
					in perception – despite years of “carbon footprint”
					messaging, more than half the public now explicitly holds
					the industry accountable in substantial measure. In essence,
					while BP’s campaign succeeded in injecting personal carbon
					footprints into the climate zeitgeist, it has not completely
					forestalled a growing public recognition that the climate
					crisis is, at its core, a systemic problem requiring
					systemic solutions.</p></div></div></section></div> <section id="perspective" class="svelte-jbdfml"><div class="sticky-text"><img src="../smoke-stack-extended.jpg" alt="Painting of a man's sillouette in smoke billowing from a smoke stack" class="smokestack-image svelte-jbdfml"> <div class="perspective svelte-jbdfml">Putting Emissions <br> Back in Perspective</div></div> <div class="content-container svelte-jbdfml"><div class="makeover-paragraph svelte-jbdfml"><div class="paragraph-2 light svelte-jbdfml"><p class="svelte-jbdfml">Climate scientists like Michael Mann argue that while
					individual actions are helpful, we must not allow the
					narrative of personal responsibility to become a distraction
					or moral smoke-screen that delays larger interventions.
					Mann’s work The New Climate War calls out tactics like BP’s
					for what they are – “soft denial” or deflection – and
					emphasizes collective action: voting for climate-conscious
					leadership, enacting carbon pricing or emissions caps on
					industry, and supporting systemic changes in energy,
					transportation, and agriculture. We should aim for a more
					balanced climate discourse that encourages individual
					“carbon footprint” reductions (such as saving energy, diet
					shifts, and conscious consumption) firmly contextualized in
					a broader push that must also include major corporate and
					governmental emissions cuts. Rather than feeling personal
					guilt as the primary response to climate change, individuals
					should channel that concern into collective action and
					demand accountability from the heavy emitters.</p> <figure class="svelte-jbdfml"><div id="lottie-animation" class="svelte-jbdfml"></div> <figcaption class="caption-1 svelte-jbdfml">Click on the chart to see your <br> emissions in
