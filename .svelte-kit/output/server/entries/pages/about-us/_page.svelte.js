				often sit buried in fragmented government databases and
				publications. Whilst the information is publicly available,
				extracting meaningful insights requires technical expertise,
				time, and resources. Thatâ€™s why at Downstream, we do the heavy
				lifting. We clean, investigate, and transform raw government
				data into engaging, interactive stories that invite exploration
				and understanding.</p> <p class="svelte-1hyx28l">We connect scattered datasets, highlight hidden patterns, and
				present information in ways that help you understand the full

				informed decisions on issues they care about.</p> <div class="fig-container-abtus svelte-1hyx28l"><figure class="figure-dessert svelte-1hyx28l"><img${attr("src", `${stringify(base)}/about-us.jpg`)} alt="Impressionist painting of a mining site" class="img1 svelte-1hyx28l"> <figcaption class="caption svelte-1hyx28l">Our mission is to create a world where the public feels
