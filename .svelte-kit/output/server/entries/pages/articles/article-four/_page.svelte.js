				it is hard to understand the units we 
				use to measure it. What does one tonne of CO2 look like? 
				How about a million tonnes of CO2? Studies have shown
				that people are surprisingly bad at grasping numbers on the scale of climate change,
				especially when they involve invisible gasses. To
				create genuine impetus for action in circles that are uninformed
				about the climate crisis, we need to start describing climate
				change in units that anyone can digest. This article attempts to
				to show that this approach has the potential to lay bare the seriousness of the climate crisis.</p></div></div></section> <section id="s-origins" class="svelte-17ayhh9"><div class="makeover-paragraph svelte-17ayhh9"><h2 class="svelte-17ayhh9">What Does the Data Say?</h2> <div class="paragraph-2 svelte-17ayhh9"><p class="svelte-17ayhh9">On average, each Australian produces 13 tonnes of CO₂ per year
				through direct emissions (7.5 tonnes) and electricity use (5.5
				tonnes), one of the highest in the developed world. To
				understand what this means, let’s look at what it takes to
				produce 1 tonne of CO2. Burning a gas stove it would take 2,551
				hours (or about 106 days) to emit 1 tonne of CO₂. Driving in a
				Toyota Camry, you could emit 1 tonne of CO₂ by driving ~5,050
				kilometres, roughly the distance of a round trip from Sydney to
				Perth.</p></div></div> <figure class="svelte-17ayhh9"><div id="infograph-1" class="svelte-17ayhh9"><img${attr("src", `${stringify(base)}/infograph-1tco2.jpg`)} alt="Infographic" class="campaign-image svelte-17ayhh9"></div> <figcaption>Simple measurements showing ways to produce 1 tonne of CO2 (source:
			UtilitySmarts)</figcaption></figure> <div class="makeover-paragraph svelte-17ayhh9"><div class="paragraph-2 svelte-17ayhh9"><p class="svelte-17ayhh9">However, these 13 tonnes of CO2 represent a tiny fraction of the
				33 million tonnes of CO₂ produced by AGL’s facilities last year
				alone. Assuming AGLs emissions are evenly spread over the year,
				how long do you think it takes for AGL to produce emissions
				equivalent to one person’s average annual output? You may be
				surprised to know the answer; AGL produces approximately one
				Australian’s annual emissions worth of CO2 of every 12.37
				seconds or 2,553,398 times each year. The chart below shows the
				surprisingly short time it takes Australia’s three largest
				emitters to produce the annual emissions of a single Australian.</p></div></div> <figure id="d3-chart" class="svelte-17ayhh9">`;

				calculators in tackling climate change, it is worth delving into
				the relative impact of our lifestyle choices. Based on our
				analysis, the average person can reduce their annual emissions
				by 7.8 tonnes per year, by taking drastic, yet achievable
				actions. This means that a dedicated individual trying to reduce
				their emissions can potentially reduce the pollution created by
				EnergyAustralias business activities every 14.76 seconds, once
				each year. Alternatively, EnergyAustralia has output 7.8t of CO2
				5-6 times since you began reading this article. It is clear that
				while from our individual perspective we may feel we are
				creating significant emissions, the reality is often that they
				are a drop in the ocean compared to those produced by
				corporations.</p> <p class="svelte-17ayhh9">Another helpful way to understand the scale of corporate
				emissions is in terms of the emissions you are expected to
				produce in your lifetime. Through showing separate cases for
				low, medium and high personal emissions, we aim to visualise how
				the climate impact of lifestyle choices varies across
				individuals. The low case represents an individual taking all
				possible action to reduce their personal emissions, for instance
				by, taking fewer international flights, living without a car and
				following a plant-based diet. The high case represents an
				individual who completely neglects to make environmentally
				conscious decisions, and the medium case is the average personal
				emissions output in Australia.</p></div></div> <figure id="d3-chart-lifetime" class="svelte-17ayhh9">`;

				individual’s lifetime personal emissions in less than one hour,
				and 107 companies in Australia achieve this feat at least once
