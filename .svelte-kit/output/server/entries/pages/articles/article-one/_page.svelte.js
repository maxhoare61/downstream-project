					expectation that it was time to begin fighting the effects
					of climate change. Public perceptions of the threat of
					climate change had increased due to devastating natural
					disasters such as the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami with a quarter
					of a million casualties. Seminal publications such as the
					Stern report also raised awareness by highlighting the
					negative economic consequences of climate change.</p> <p class="svelte-nrmby8">Companies tied to carbon emitting practices found themselves
					in a difficult position where the public actually cared
					about their damaging behaviors. This was bad for business,
					but the secondary effects of such a shift were significant
					as well. Greater public interest in climate change could
					pressure politicians into policy reforms aimed at
					restricting emissions.</p> <p class="svelte-nrmby8">The reality was that without some intervention, corporate
					emitters were looking at an existential threat. Over the
					following years, numerous campaigns sprung up with the aim
					of redirecting public climate anxiety in a new direction.</p> <p class="svelte-nrmby8">The carbon footprint was an idea borne from this movement to
					distract from corporate environmental damaging by encourage
					people to view emissions in terms of their everyday choices
					such as diet, transport and overseas travel.</p></div> <div class="pictures-2 svelte-nrmby8"><figure class="svelte-nrmby8"><img${attr("src", `${stringify(base)}/bp-cf-ads.jpg`)} alt="BP's Advertising Campaign" class="campaign-image svelte-nrmby8"> <figcaption>The original BP carbon campaign from 2005 (source: XXX)</figcaption></figure> <figure class="svelte-nrmby8"><img${attr("src", `${stringify(base)}/cfc-screenshot.jpg`)} alt="Early Carbon Footprint Calculator" class="campaign-image calc svelte-nrmby8"> <figcaption>An early carbon footprint calculator (source: soft112)</figcaption></figure></div></div></section></div> <figure class="sticky-text svelte-nrmby8"><img${attr("src", `${stringify(base)}/smoke-stack-extended.jpg`)} alt="Painting of a man's sillouette in smoke billowing from a smoke stack" class="smokestack-image svelte-nrmby8"> <div class="perspective above svelte-nrmby8">Putting Emissions Back in Perspective</div></figure> <section id="perspective" class="svelte-nrmby8"><div class="content-container"><div class="content-box-2 svelte-nrmby8"><div class="paragraph-2 light wht-brdr svelte-nrmby8"><p class="svelte-nrmby8">With a lack of accurate information, our collective sense of
					where emissions originate has been distorted.</p> <p class="svelte-nrmby8">The overwhelming sense of powerlessness and other negative
					emotions that come from taking individual responsibility
					drives individuals toward climate denial.</p> <p class="svelte-nrmby8">The reality is that individuals' actions are important. How
					we incorporate sustainability into our lives sets an example
					for others and encourages a positive attitude toward these
					behaviors. The problem is that our sense of how serious
					these impacts are has become inflated compared to corporate
					emitters, who have the most real power to make a change.</p> <p class="svelte-nrmby8">How can we use the tools available to us to help recover a

					The reverse carbon calculator is a tool which calculates your carbon footprint much like other carbon footprint calculators except with a key difference.
					While many carbon footprint calculators aim to emphasise your impact on the planet, our tool compares your individual emissions to those produced by several corporations.</p> <p class="svelte-nrmby8">The purpose of this is to help 'zoom out' our idea of which actions will really make a difference to the climate in the long run. 
					Our personal actions are big on the scale of our day to day lives which can lead us to believe they have an outsided impact compared to their actually significance.
					For instance, while it can be beneficial to cycle to a destination instead of driving, the effort required to do this may be better directed toward pushing for change in 
					business and politics, since decisions in these spaces can have consequences on a large scale.</p></div> <div class="pictures-2 chart svelte-nrmby8"><figure class="svelte-nrmby8"><div id="lottie-animation" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;" class="svelte-nrmby8"></div> <div class="caption-1 svelte-nrmby8">Click on the chart to see your <br> emissions in perspective.</div></figure></div></div></div></section>`;
